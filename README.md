# Farm Fresh - *LuluTweet*

Description of the Project 
Brief
We intend to bridge home grown or farm grown foods(fruits,vegetables) be it organic or non-organic directly with consumers.

Structure
The application provides a platform where folks can browse for food items in and around their location or in a specific 
location. If interested the user can then create a login and buy the food item. The same user can also sell food items or
even exchange food items (true for individuals with some flora in their backyard) with those around her/him. 

Scope
The app is targeted towards folks who wish to buy/sell products directly from local farms or from individuals around them.
