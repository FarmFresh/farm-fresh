# Farm Fresh - *Prabhu Babu, Bhaskar Jaiswal, Lulu Li*

**Farm Fresh ** is an android app that allows a user to view home and mentions timelines, view user profiles with user timelines, as well as compose and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Motivation
Organic food industry is a hot area of growth. Many home grown or farm grown organic foods never make to the farmer’s market or grocery stores. We intend to bridge home grown or farm grown organic foods (fruits,vegetables) directly with consumers. The app is targeted towards folks who wish to buy/sell products directly from local farms or individuals.
